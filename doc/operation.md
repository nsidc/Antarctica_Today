The one set of files that is required but not generated by this code are the 37h
threshold binaries provided by Tom Mote. These are checked in to this repository.

## 1. Download NSIDC-0080

Download all NSIDC-0080 granules:

```
PYTHONPATH=. python antarctica_today/nsidc_download_Tb_data.py
```

> :memo: Note
>
> For data before 2016, `NSIDC-0001` and `NSIDC-0007` are used.
>
> 🛠️ _TODO_
>
> - [ ] Does this mean we need to download 0001 and 0007 too to initialize the db?
> - [ ] Add functionality to CLI if needed.


## 2. Generate all the daily melt binary files

```
PYTHONPATH=. python antarctica_today/generate_daily_melt_file.py
```

> :memo: Note
>
> Binaries provided in `data/daily_melt_bin_files` already calibrated by
> Tom Mote for pre 2016 dates.
>
> 🛠️ _TODO_
>
> - [ ] Add functionality to CLI if needed.


## 3. Generate the database

This software manages a database covering the full climatology in the form of a pickle
file.


> TODO: ?is this as simple as:

> ```
> PYTHONPATH=. python antarctica_today/main.py preprocess

### Initializing

> 🛠️ _TODO_
>
> - [ ] Simpler command, shouldn't have to know to set PYTHONPATH.
> - [ ] Add functionality to CLI if needed.

Create the melt array picklefile, a file containing a 2d grid for each day:

```
PYTHONPATH=. python antarctica_today/melt_array_picklefile.py
```

Create a gap filled melt picklefile, (TODO: What is it?):

```
PYTHONPATH=. python antarctica_today/generate_gap_filled_melt_picklefile.py
```


### Daily updates

> 🛠️ _TODO_
>
> - [ ] Simpler command, shouldn't have to know to set PYTHONPATH.
> - [ ] Add functionality to CLI if needed.

> :warning: Warning
>
> All initialization steps above must be completed first.

```
PYTHONPATH=. python antarctica_today/update_data.py
```


## 4. Generate outputs

Run the main CLI's `process` command.

```
PYTHONPATH=. python antarctica_today/main.py process
```
